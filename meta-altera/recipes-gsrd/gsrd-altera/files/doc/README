1. Soft IP Driver Example
=========================
GPIO driver for soft PIO in the FPGA domain serves as a reference for
writing a simple driver in Linux. The source code of this driver is located in
Linux source directory under the folder drivers/gpio/gpio-altera.c. The tarball
of Linux source code can be found from the extraction of self extracting
file (BSX) in the development kit installation after you have extracted the
BSX file (<BSX_extract_path>/sources/linux-altera-3.7.tgz). The specification
of soft PIO can be found in Embedded Peripherals IP User Guide - Altera
(http://www.altera.com.my/literature/ug/ug_embedded_ip.pdf).

NOTE:
This example does not serve as a full guideline on how to write a Linux Device
Driver. For full guidelines, please refer to Linux Device Driver reference book
(http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/)

In this reference design, soft PIO kernel module and leds_gpio kernel module are
modprobe by default when boot into Linux. User will need to modprobe the modules
via command below if these modules are not inserted yet. Modprobe of these
modules are prerequisite to run any applications in section 2.
	modprobe gpio-altera
	modprobe leds_gpio


2. Application Examples
=======================
Users may run applications (LED control, detect interrupts from push
buttons and DIP switches, etc) built into Linux file system on the board from
Linux console over ssh or serial connection.

These examples serve as references for users to write their own applications
to interact with soft IP through driver developed.

The source codes of these applications can be found from the installation path
of BSX (<Yocto_install_path>/meta-altera/recipes-gsrd).

The binaries of these applications can be found in /home/root/altera/. Please
'cd' to /home/root/altera to execute these applications.

Example applications usages are shown below, the example applications are based
on soft PIO driver described in Section 1.


Applications to exercise soft PIO driver - LED control
------------------------------------------------------
Blinking a particular FPGA LED with specified delay:
	./blink <LED number> <blink delay in ms>
	./blink			; help message
Toggling a particular FPGA LED ON/OFF:
	./toggle <LED number> <0 or 1>	; 0:OFF, 1:ON)
	./toggle			; help message
Scrolling FPGA LEDs with specified delay:
	./scroll <delay in ms> 	; if > 0 then scrolling LEDs light
	./scroll 0		; if == 0 then read scrolling delay
	./scroll -1		; if < 0 then stop scrolling
	./scroll		; help message


Application to register interrupt and write simple interrupt service routine
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect user input from push button / DIP switch:
	modprobe gpio_interrupt gpio_number=<n>

When user presses the button or flips the dip switch, a message will be printed
to kernel console.
1. If the user connects to the console on board using serial connection,
the message "Interrupt happened at gpio:<gpio_number>" will be printed on the
console.
2. If the user connects to the console on board using ssh, the message can be
viewed from kernel log via "dmesg" command.

User will need to get the GPIO number from /sys/class/gpio/ by using
command 'ls'. E.g.

	root@socfpga-cyclone5~:# ls /sys/class/gpio/
	export	gpio246	   gpio248  gpio252

From the listing, n can be obtained. The GPIO number may vary for different
design with different device tree entries; this is due to the GPIO numbers are
auto-assign by the kernel.

To confirm the n is associated to which peripheral, user needs to match the
label of the GPIO chip to the address of push button and DIP switch in device
tree (<Yocto_install_path>/meta-altera/recipes-gsrd/files/socfpga.dts).
e.g.
	root@socfpga-cyclone5~:# cat /sys/class/gpio/gpiochip246/label
	/soc/gpio@0x100c0

In this reference design, DIP switch is at address 0x10080 while the push button
is at address 0x100c0. So in this case GPIO number 246 - 247 are allocated to
push button 0 - 1.


Hello world application from HPS
--------------------------------
Print "Hello SoC FPGA!" message from HPS:
	./hello
